#### Required libraries
* Pygame
* Shelve

#### Current list of features:

* Organisms
  * Species name
  * Insulation
  * Size
  * Speed
  * Sex
  * Breeding (plants breed asexually)
  * Plants, and animals
  * Colour
  * Fitness
  * Energy
  * Lifespan
  * Eating
  * Aggression value
  * Defensiveness value
  * Predation on plants, and other animals

* Environment
  * Temperature
  * Slope
  * Water

* Meta
  * Saving/loading simulations
  * Saving/loading individual organisms
  * Killing individual organisms
  * Killing one species
  * Killing the smallest half of organisms
  * Population graph
  * Population limit **(can be adjusted in the code)**
  * Display information on an organism
  * WASD to move map around

* TODO:
  * Give creatures adaptable behaviour via a neural network... somehow
  * Make multiple temperature zones, so maybe different ecosystems can form
